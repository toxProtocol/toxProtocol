- **Welcome to toxProtocol.** 
- _"a hub for innovation in digital security and protocol analysis.”_
- Driven by curiosity and a keen interest in secure communication, this GitHub profile is 
dedicated to exploring tools, scripts, and protocols that ensure data integrity and protection.

- toxProtocol’s purpose is to experiment, prototype, and refine security-centric utilities 
for digital environments. With a particular focus on protocol management and analysis, this 
profile is geared towards learning and sharing resources with the open-source community.

- 🔭 Exploring fundamental tools and techniques for security 
testing and analysis. Currently exploring Python, C++, and 
Bash scripting for automating security tasks.
- 🌱 A focus on the development of tools that contribute to 
secure communication protocols and help analyze traffic for vulnerabilities.
- 👯 Building and contributing to projects that encourage 
transparency and safety in digital environments.
- 🤔 I’m looking for more cybersecurity, DevSecOp's and other IT insight's.
OSINT, SecOps practices, and the basics of protocol analysis are among interests.
